# hls4ml-vs-verilog
For L46

Notebooks that were used to run hls4ml, generate verilog and run synthesis are given in /notebooks. These were run in a docker container with Vivado, as per the instructions in https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml-tutorial  

The Verilog code for the custom layer implementations is given in /verilog. This should used to replace the generated verilog from hls4ml.  

/hls contains the attempts at producing custom HLS implementations.
